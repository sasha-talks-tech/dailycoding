# Daily Coding Practice Repository
Welcome to my Daily Coding Practice repository! 🚀

## 📌 About This Repository
This repository is a collection of coding problems I solve on a daily basis to enhance my skills in algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving across various domains. Each problem includes:

- Problem statement for context and requirements.
- Multiple solutions with different approaches, focusing on time and space complexity.
- Detailed explanations and step-by-step breakdowns to provide clarity on how each solution works.
- Language-specific implementations, primarily in Python, with occasional implementations in other languages.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools
- Primary language: Python
- Version control: Git and GitHub

## 📝 Notes & Explanations
Each solution is accompanied by a markdown notes containing:

- Explanation of the logic and thought process.
- Time complexity analysis.
- Alternative solutions with pros and cons.
- Key learnings from solving the problem.

## 🎯 Goals of This Repository
- Practice algorithmic problem-solving daily.
- Explore and understand different approaches to solving coding challenges.
- Share detailed solutions to help others in their learning journey.
- Track my progress over time.

## 📚 Learning Resources
I also reference popular resources like:

- LeetCode
- CodeWars
- HackerRank
- GeeksforGeeks
